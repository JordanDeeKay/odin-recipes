            </li>
            <li>
                Place beef bones on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven until browned, about one hour.

            <li>
                Place onion on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven until blackened and soft, about 45 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place bones, onion, ginger, salt, star anise, and fish sauce in a large stockpot and cover with four quarts of water. 
                Bring to a boil and reduce heat to low. 
                Simmer on low for six to 10 hours. 
                Strain the broth into a saucepan and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place rice noodles in a large bowl filled with room temperature water and allow to soak for one hour. 
                Bring a large pot of water to a boil and after the noodles have soaked, place them in the boiling water for one minute. 
                Bring stock to a simmer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide noodles among four serving bowls; 
                top with sirloin, cilantro, and green onion. 
                Pour hot broth over the top. 
                Stir and let sit until the beef is partially cooked and no longer pink, one to two minutes. 
                Serve with bean sprouts, Thai basil, lime wedges, hoisin sauce, and chile-garlic sauce on the side.
